How to create risks model?

For example: 
1.  Model Types
Frequency Models - Predict how often claims occur (Poisson, Negative Binomial)
Severity Models - Predict claim amounts when they occur (Gamma, Lognormal, Pareto)
Pure Premium Models - Combine frequency Ã— severity
Classification Models - Predict risk categories or binary outcomes
2. Essential Data Variables
Driver Characteristics:

Age, gender, marital status
Driving experience and license history
Credit score (where legally permitted)
Claims and violation history
Occupation and education level
Vehicle Information:

Make, model, year, engine size
Safety ratings and features
Anti-theft devices
Vehicle value and replacement cost
Usage type (personal, business, pleasure)
Geographic Factors:

ZIP code or territory
Population density
Weather patterns
Crime rates
Traffic density
Policy Details:

Coverage limits and deductibles
Policy tenure
Multi-policy discounts
Payment method
Modeling Methodology
3. Statistical Approaches
Traditional Methods:

Generalized Linear Models (GLM) - Industry standard for frequency/severity
Decision Trees - Easy interpretation, handles interactions
Logistic Regression - For binary classification (claim/no claim)
Advanced Techniques:

Random Forest/Gradient Boosting - Better predictive power
Neural Networks - Complex pattern recognition
Ensemble Methods - Combine multiple models


4. Model Development Workflow
Data Preparation:

Data collection and validation
Missing value treatment
Outlier detection and handling
Feature engineering and transformation
Variable selection and correlation analysis
Model Building:

Split data (train/validation/test)
Baseline model development
Feature selection and interaction testing
Hyperparameter tuning
Cross-validation
Model Validation:

Statistical significance testing
Predictive accuracy metrics (AUC, Gini, RMSE)
Business validation (lift charts, rate adequacy)
Regulatory compliance checks
Implementation Considerations

5. Regulatory & Business Constraints
Rate Filing Requirements - Models must be explainable to regulators
Fairness and Discrimination - Avoid protected class bias
Territorial Restrictions - Geographic rating limitations
Rate Stability - Minimize year-over-year volatility

7. Best Practices

Model Interpretability - Use explainable AI techniques
Regular Monitoring - Track model performance over time
A/B Testing - Validate model improvements
Documentation - Maintain detailed model documentation
Backtesting - Validate on historical out-of-sample data

7. Technology Stack
Statistical Software: R, SAS, Python (scikit-learn, statsmodels)
Big Data Platforms: Spark, Hadoop for large datasets
Cloud Services: AWS, Azure, GCP for scalability
Visualization: Tableau, Power BI for stakeholder communication
Key Success Metrics
Predictive Accuracy - How well the model ranks risk
Rate Adequacy - Premiums cover expected losses plus expenses
Competitive Position - Pricing competitiveness in market
Regulatory Compliance - Adherence to state regulations
Profitability - Contribution to underwriting profit
