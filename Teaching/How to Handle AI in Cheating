The Tom Sawyer Test: Understanding the Spectrum of AI Use
Remember the story of Tom Sawyer and the fence? Just like Tom tricked his friend into painting the fence for him, students might be tempted to use ChatGPT to complete their assignments. But the key question is: what’s the purpose of the assignment?

If the goal is simply to have an essay completed, then using AI might seem like a valid solution. However, as educators, we know that the true purpose of writing assignments is to help students develop and showcase their skills. This is where the spectrum of AI use comes into play.

On one end of the spectrum, we have essays that are entirely AI-generated, which is clearly unethical. On the other end, we have students who write independently, without any AI assistance. But there’s a lot of middle ground, such as:

AI generating multiple drafts, and the student choosing the best parts
AI guiding the student through the writing process as a coach
The student writing until they’re stuck, then asking AI for help
The student writing all the content, but using AI for feedback and improvement
As educators, it’s our responsibility to teach students how to use AI ethically and effectively, recognizing the different levels of AI involvement in their work.

Here’s a graphic that helps in this process, by Matt Miller from Ditch that Textbook:
