## Why Empirica Needs an Enterprise Control Plane

### Why Empirica Alone Is Insufficient

Empirica is excellent for experimentation but assumes:

- A single operator
- Manual deployment
- Trust in experiment code
- Local or lightly managed hosting

These assumptions do not hold in:

- Enterprise strategy simulations

- Cross-organization collaboration labs

- Classroom-to-portfolio pipelines

- Research programs requiring auditability

SkillLedger introduces an enterprise control plane around Empirica.
